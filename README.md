A simple command line IRC.
It is based on RFC 1459.
You have to first launch the server part.
Once inside the client, you have to connect to a server: /server ip:port
then you can use following commands:
/nick <nickname> //setting up username
/list // list channels
/join <channel> //join a channel
/part // leave a channel
/users // list users
/msg <nickname> <msg> // send private msg
